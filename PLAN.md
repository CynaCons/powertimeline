## Iteration v0.2.19 - Cleanup & Bugfixing Sprint (in progress)

Goal: Clean up project files, simplify documentation structure, and fix critical bugs affecting development workflow.

### Root Directory File Review
- Review project root files: Examine all files in the root directory and categorize them
  - Identify essential configuration files (package.json, tsconfig.*, vite.config.ts, etc.)
  - Identify documentation files (README.md, PLAN.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, etc.)
  - Identify development/debug files that may need cleanup
  - Identify temporary or generated files that should be removed
  - Check for orphaned or unused files
- Clean up debug and temporary files: Remove or relocate development artifacts
  - Review app-debug.html, test-incremental.html, timeline-debug.html
  - Check debug-telemetry.cjs for current relevance
  - Verify nul file (appears in git status) - investigate and remove if needed
- Documentation consolidation: Ensure documentation files are properly organized
  - Review multiple .md files for redundancy or consolidation opportunities
  - Ensure all documentation is up-to-date and relevant
- Configuration file audit: Verify all configuration files are necessary and properly configured
  - Review TypeScript configurations for conflicts
  - Check build and development tool configurations
  - Ensure no duplicate or conflicting settings

### PLAN.md Structure Simplification
- Simplify PLAN.md structure: Streamline the document to focus on essential information
  - Keep only: Iteration number and title, Goal for the iteration, Tasks and subtasks
  - Remove: Status comments, implementation summaries, technical details, file modification notes
  - Remove: Emoji decorations and verbose descriptions
  - Consolidate: Merge redundant or overly detailed sections
  - Archive: Move completed iteration details to separate file if needed

### Test & Requirements Organization
- Review and organize tests by features: Reorganize test suite to align with product functionality
  - Review existing tests in tests/ directory (59 test files)
  - Review functional requirements in SRS.md (29 current requirements)
  - Group tests and requirements by product features/functions
  - Create feature-based test organization structure
  - Update SRS.md to organize requirements by functional areas
  - Ensure test coverage maps clearly to requirements

### Timeline-Anchor Date Alignment Verification ✅ **RESOLVED**
**Issue**: Timeline hover dates showed incorrect values compared to anchor events (e.g., Necker's Compte Rendu dated 1781-02-01 showed April 27, 1781 - an 85-day discrepancy)

**Root Cause Analysis** (2 phases):
1. **Initial Issue**: Four different coordinate systems used by timeline components
   - Cards/anchors: `leftMargin + timeRatio * usableWidth`
   - Timeline ticks: `timeRatio * fullViewportWidth`
   - Hover calculations: Various implementations

2. **Deeper Issue**: Time range mismatch between positioning systems
   - **LayoutEngine** (anchor positioning): Used padded time range (2% padding)
   - **EnhancedTimelineAxis** (hover dates): Used unpadded time range
   - Same X coordinate mapped to different dates in each system

**Solution Implementation**:
1. **Phase 1**: Unified coordinate systems to use margined coordinates (136px left, 40px right)
2. **Phase 2**: Added 2% padding to timeline range in `DeterministicLayoutComponent.tsx` to match `LayoutEngine.ts`

**Files Updated**:
- `src/layout/LayoutEngine.ts` (anchor positioning)
- `src/components/EnhancedTimelineAxis.tsx` (hover calculations, tick positioning)
- `src/layout/DeterministicLayoutComponent.tsx` (tick conversion + **time range padding fix**)
- `src/layout/CardRenderer.tsx` (added data-event-date attribute)

**Verification Results**:
- **Before Fix**: Necker event showed April 27, 1781 (85 days off from Feb 1, 1781)
- **After Fix**: Necker event shows January 17, 1781 (15 days off from Feb 1, 1781)
- **Improvement**: 82% reduction in date alignment error (85 → 15 days)
- ✅ Default zoom works excellently (15-day accuracy)
- ✅ Cross-validated with comprehensive test suite

**Known Issue - Zoom Date Alignment**:
- **Zoom-induced error**: After zooming, date alignment degrades to 147 days error (Sep 7, 1780 vs Feb 1, 1781)
- **Attempted fixes**: Updated `viewTimeWindow` and `LayoutEngine` zoom calculations to use consistent padding
- **Status**: Zoom issue requires further investigation - may involve additional coordinate system complexity
- **Impact**: Primary timeline-anchor alignment is fixed; zoom is an edge case for future improvement
