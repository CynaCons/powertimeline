# Implementation Plan - Enhanced Deterministic Layout v5

## Executive Summary

**Primary Goal**: Perfect the card placement and degradation system BEFORE implementing user features.

**Key Principle**: The layout engine must handle complex scenarios (multi-clustered seeds, 60+ events) with zero overlaps and graceful degradation before we add any visual polish or user interactions.

## Overview

Implementation of the corrected and enhanced deterministic layout algorithm based on updated user specifications:
- **Corrected slot allocation**: Full(4), Compact(8), Title-only(8), Multi-event(4)
- **Independent above/below layouts** with decorrelated clustering
- **Horizontal space optimization** across full timeline width
- **Timeline-driven process**: bounds ‚Üí dispatch ‚Üí cluster ‚Üí fit ‚Üí degrade

## Previous Development Status

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL FINDINGS FROM SCREENSHOT ANALYSIS

After analyzing screenshots from all test scenarios (including new Clustered x5 with 75+ events):

#### üî¥ **BREAKING ISSUES - Visual Rendering Not Matching Layout Engine**
1. **NO TIMELINE AXIS VISIBLE** - Complete absence of horizontal timeline, date labels, tick marks
2. **NO VISUAL DEGRADATION** - All cards same size despite high density (Napoleon 63, Clustered x5 75+)
3. **POOR HORIZONTAL DISTRIBUTION** - Cards bunched on left, 70% of viewport unused
4. **NO ANCHOR MARKERS** - Missing temporal anchors and connection lines
5. **CARD OVERLAPS** - Despite "zero-overlap guarantee" in tests

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Layout Engine vs Visual Rendering Mismatch**
- **Layout Engine (DeterministicLayoutV5)**: ‚úÖ Tests pass, telemetry correct
- **Visual Rendering (Timeline.tsx)**: ‚ùå Not implementing calculated positions
- **Root Cause**: Disconnect between layout calculations and DOM rendering

### ‚úÖ What's Actually Working (Backend Only)
- ‚úÖ Complete v5 test suite (16 tests passing including x5)
- ‚úÖ CapacityModel.ts calculations correct
- ‚úÖ DeterministicLayoutV5.ts producing valid layouts
- ‚úÖ Telemetry reporting accurate metrics
- ‚ùå BUT: Visual output doesn't match calculations

### üö® EMERGENCY REPRIORITIZATION NEEDED

#### **NEW Stage 3A: Fix Visual Rendering Pipeline** üî• (IMMEDIATE)
- Fix Timeline.tsx to actually use DeterministicLayoutV5 positions
- Ensure calculated layouts are applied to DOM elements
- Debug why layout engine output isn't being rendered

#### **NEW Stage 3B: Timeline Axis Implementation** üî• (URGENT)
- **MUST DO FIRST** - Cannot verify anything without axis
- Move Phase 10.1 here immediately
- Add horizontal line, date labels, tick marks
- Without this, we're flying blind

#### **Stage 3C: Original Degradation System** (After 3A & 3B)
- Now depends on fixing visual rendering first
- Original Stage 3 items postponed

### üéØ Immediate Action Items (Today's Priority)
1. **DEBUG**: Why is Timeline.tsx not using layout positions?
2. **FIX**: Connect DeterministicLayoutV5 output to actual card rendering
3. **IMPLEMENT**: Timeline axis (Phase 10.1) - CANNOT PROCEED WITHOUT THIS
4. **VERIFY**: Visual output matches layout calculations

### üêõ Visual Bugs Fixed & Remaining

| Bug | Expected | Status | Notes |
|-----|----------|--------|-------|
| **No Timeline** | Horizontal line with date labels | ‚úÖ FIXED | Added thick line, date labels, tick marks |
| **No Anchors** | Dots/triangles on timeline | ‚úÖ FIXED | Blue dots with event count badges |
| **Card Types** | Visual differentiation | ‚úÖ FIXED | Colored left borders (blue/green/yellow/purple) |
| **Card Position** | Use calculated x,y | ‚úÖ FIXED | Fixed width/height property names |
| **No Degradation** | Different card sizes by density | ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL | Colors show types but sizes still same |
| **Bad Distribution** | Full viewport width usage | ‚ùå TODO | Still bunched, needs better dispatch |
| **Card Overlaps** | Zero overlaps guaranteed | ‚ùå TODO | Some overlaps remain |

### üìä Test Scenario Evidence

| Scenario | Events | What Should Happen | What Actually Happens |
|----------|--------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Clustered x5** | 75+ | Heavy degradation, multi-event cards | All individual cards, severe bunching |
| **Napoleon** | 63 | Mixed card types, good distribution | All same size, poor distribution |
| **Clustered x3** | 45 | 3 distinct clusters, some degradation | Bunched left, no degradation |

Note: Section numbering below remains for continuity; the roadmap above defines the execution order.

### 9.9 Visual polish from v5 screenshots (New)

Quick wins (low risk)
- [ ] Axis polish
	- [ ] Stronger baseline (1‚Äì2px), adaptive label format by zoom (e.g., YYYY vs Mon YYYY)
	- [ ] Guard against label collisions on long-range; minor grid lines only at low density
	- [ ] Add subtle start/end caps and padding so content doesn‚Äôt hug edges
- [ ] Centered anchors & column boundaries
	- [ ] Add a small centered anchor marker (triangle/chevron) at temporal center
	- [ ] Optional faint vertical column guides spanning above/below to improve grouping perception
	- [ ] Ensure consistent horizontal gutter between columns at high density
- [ ] Card hierarchy & spacing
	- [ ] Set per-type typography scales and line-heights (Full > Compact > Title-only)
	- [ ] Enforce single-line ellipsis for Compact/Title-only; no two-line wrapping in dense views
	- [ ] Use 1px border + subtle shadow + small radius for crisp separation
	- [ ] Maintain minimum gutters from the axis and between stacked cards
- [ ] Multi-event content pattern
	- [ ] Render as bullet-style list (max 5) with clear separators
	- [ ] Visible "+N" overflow badge when events exceed 5
- [ ] Card type tokens
	- [ ] Left color strip and small badge/icon per type (not color-only)
	- [ ] Ensure WCAG AA contrast for text and borders on all backgrounds

Medium / larger items
- [ ] Dynamic tick stepping algorithm tied to zoom density
- [ ] Cluster badge near anchor with count; intensity varies with density
- [ ] Group pitch visualization in overlay (target vs actual band), wired to telemetry
- [ ] Overlay reflow/collapse affordances for small viewports (no obstruction of cards)
- [ ] Dark mode pass with tokenized colors, borders, radii, spacing

Validation
- [ ] Extend v5 screenshot tests to cover the above and keep artifacts under `test-results/screenshots/`

## Phase 10: Critical Visual Features from Screenshot Analysis

### 10.1 Timeline Axis Implementation (STAGE 4 - CRITICAL FOR VERIFICATION)
- [ ] Add timeline axis component with date labels and tick marks
- [ ] Implement D3.js time scale or similar for proper temporal mapping
- [ ] Add adaptive tick formatting (MM/DD for days, MMM for months, YYYY for years)
- [ ] Ensure labels don't overlap with responsive tick density
- [ ] Add axis line with 2px stroke weight for visibility
- [ ] Position labels below timeline with proper spacing

### 10.2 Horizontal Space Optimization (STAGE 2 - Part of Clustering)
- [ ] Reduce left/right viewport padding from 50px to 20px
- [ ] Calculate timeline start position dynamically to maximize usable width
- [ ] Adjust first column X position to start closer to viewport edge
- [ ] Update timeToX calculation to use full viewport width efficiently
- [ ] Add telemetry for horizontal space utilization percentage

### 10.3 Visual Card Type Differentiation (STAGE 6 - Visual Polish)
- [ ] Add colored left border strips (4px wide) per card type
- [ ] Implement typography scale: Full=14px, Compact=13px, Title=12px
- [ ] Set card heights: Full=80px, Compact=60px, Title=40px
- [ ] Add type badges (F/C/T/M) in top-right corner
- [ ] Apply subtle background tints per type for additional clarity

### 10.4 Timeline Anchor Markers (STAGE 4 - Temporal Accuracy)
- [ ] Add visible dots/triangles on timeline at cluster centers
- [ ] Connect cards to anchors with subtle stem lines
- [ ] Ensure anchors align with temporal midpoint of clusters
- [ ] Add hover state to highlight card-anchor relationships

### 10.5 Multi-Event Aggregation Implementation (STAGE 3 - Part of Degradation)
- [ ] Trigger multi-event cards when cluster density > 6 events
- [ ] Implement bullet list layout for multi-event content
- [ ] Add "+N more" badges for overflow beyond 5 events
- [ ] Test with clustered 2x and 3x scenarios for proper degradation

## Implementation Notes

### Technical Decisions (Revised Priorities)
- **FIRST**: Consolidate to single canonical layout engine (remove experimental implementations)
- **SECOND**: Implement real promotion/degradation logic (no placeholders)
- **THIRD**: Add timeline axis early for temporal verification
- Use TypeScript for type safety in slot calculations
- Implement immutable layout state for predictability
- Defer canvas-based rendering until HTML performance proven insufficient

### Testing Strategy
- **Multi-clustered seeds are PRIMARY test cases** (not edge cases)
- Each stage must pass with clustered x3 scenario before proceeding
- Napoleon timeline (63 events) is the benchmark for "working system"
- Visual regression tests capture each degradation state

### Monitoring & Metrics
- Track slot utilization efficiency
- Monitor horizontal space usage percentages
- Measure clustering effectiveness
- Log degradation frequency and causes
- **Critical metric**: Zero overlaps at any density level

This plan ensures complete compliance with the enhanced architecture specifications while maintaining the deterministic, zero-overlap guarantee.
