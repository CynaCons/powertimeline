- [x] Document data structures and routing patterns
- [x] Plan 16 Playwright test scenarios

**User Experience:**
- [ ] Design landing page layout (similar to GitHub homepage)
- [ ] Create user list/directory view (using mock/demo users: Alice, Bob, Charlie)
- [ ] Display timeline cards per user (title, description, event count, preview)
- [ ] Click user → view user's timeline list
- [ ] Click timeline → navigate to timeline editor/viewer
- [ ] Add basic search/filter by timeline title
- [ ] Add timeline preview on hover (minimap thumbnail)

**Routing & Navigation:**
- [ ] Implement URL routing structure: `/user/:userId` and `/user/:userId/timeline/:timelineId`
- [ ] Add browser navigation (back/forward) support
- [ ] Add breadcrumb navigation (Home > User > Timeline)

**Data Management:**
- [ ] Use localStorage for timeline data (no backend yet)
