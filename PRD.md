## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Layer
**Core Technologies:**
- React 19+ with TypeScript for type safety and modern concurrent features
- Tailwind CSS for responsive, mobile-first design
- SVG-based timeline visualization for infinite scalability
- Vite for fast development and optimized production builds

**State Management:**
- React Context for global application state
- Local state with hooks for component-level state
- Optimistic UI updates for responsive collaboration

**Testing & Quality:**
- Playwright end-to-end testing suite (160+ tests)
- TypeScript strict mode for compile-time safety
- ESLint + Prettier for code consistency
- Pre-commit hooks for quality gates

### Backend & Storage Layer
**Timeline Storage:**
- Internal Git repositories for each timeline (one repo per timeline)
- JSON format for timeline data serialization (optimized for Git diffs)
- Git commit history provides complete version control
- Branch-based workflow for draft changes and merge requests

**Version Control Operations:**
- Simple-git or NodeGit for Git operations
- Automatic commit generation on timeline saves
- Branch creation for forks and drafts
- Merge conflict detection and resolution UI
- Internal Git operations (not exposed as public Git hosting)

**Database (Firebase Firestore):**
- User profiles and authentication data
- Timeline metadata (title, description, visibility, statistics)
- Fork relationships and attribution graphs
- Activity feeds and notifications
- Search indices for timeline discovery

**File Storage (Firebase Storage):**
- Media attachments (images, videos, documents)
- Timeline Git repository backups
- Export archives (YAML, JSON, PDF)

### API Layer
**RESTful API Endpoints:**
```
GET    /api/timelines              # List public timelines
GET    /api/timelines/:id          # Get timeline details
POST   /api/timelines              # Create new timeline
PUT    /api/timelines/:id          # Update timeline
DELETE /api/timelines/:id          # Delete timeline

POST   /api/timelines/:id/fork     # Fork timeline
POST   /api/timelines/:id/merge    # Create merge request
GET    /api/timelines/:id/history  # Get version history
GET    /api/timelines/:id/diff     # Get diff between versions

GET    /api/users/:id              # Get user profile
GET    /api/users/:id/timelines    # Get user's timelines
POST   /api/users/:id/follow       # Follow user

GET    /api/search                 # Search timelines
GET    /api/trending               # Get trending timelines
```

**GraphQL Alternative (Future):**
- Consider GraphQL for complex queries and reduced API calls
- Flexible data fetching for timeline relationships
- Real-time subscriptions for collaborative features

### Authentication & Authorization
**User Authentication (Firebase Auth):**
- Email/password authentication
- OAuth providers (Google, GitHub, Twitter)
- Anonymous browsing for public timelines
- JWT-based session management

**Authorization Model:**
- Timeline ownership (creator has full control)
- Visibility levels (public, unlisted, private)
- Collaborator permissions (read, comment, edit)
- Organization/team support (future)

**Firestore Security Rules:**
```javascript
// Timeline access control
allow read: if resource.data.visibility == 'public'
            || request.auth.uid == resource.data.ownerId
            || request.auth.uid in resource.data.collaborators;

allow write: if request.auth.uid == resource.data.ownerId;
```

### Git-Based Version Control Workflow
**Timeline Lifecycle:**
1. User creates timeline → Initialize Git repository
2. User makes edits → Create commits with change descriptions
3. User saves → Push to main branch
4. User forks → Clone repository to new timeline
5. User creates merge request → Compare branches, show diff
6. Owner reviews → Approve/reject changes
7. Owner merges → Git merge with conflict resolution

**Branch Strategy:**
- `main` - Published version of timeline
- `draft` - Work-in-progress edits
- `fork-{username}` - Forked versions
- `merge-request-{id}` - Pending merge requests

**Commit Message Format:**
```
type(scope): description

- Added event: "Event Title" (1945-05-08)
- Updated event: "Event Title" (changed description)
- Deleted event: "Event Title"
```

### Performance & Scalability
**Frontend Performance:**
