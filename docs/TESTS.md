## Updating This Document

### Full Test Suite + Update (10-15 minutes)

Run the automated refresh script to execute all tests and update this document:

```powershell
npm run test:update-doc
```

This command executes the v5 suite with the JSON reporter, regenerates the sections marked above, and leaves raw artifacts under `tmp/test-docs/`.
It exits with the same status as Playwright, so expect a non-zero code while failures remain.

**Note:** Running all 169 tests takes 10-15 minutes. The script will appear to hang but is actually running tests.

### Quick Update from Existing Results (instant)

If you just want to regenerate TESTS.md from the most recent test run without re-running all tests:

```powershell
node scripts/generate-test-doc.js --write-doc
```

This uses the cached results from `tmp/test-docs/test-results.json` and completes instantly.

## Version History

- **v0.3.1** (current): Automated Playwright run on 2025-09-26 (v1.54.2). 8 / 65 spec files passing.
- **Historical status:** No earlier recorded runs.

## Notes

- Maintain telemetry suites as golden baseline—they currently exercise working instrumentation.
- Focus future fixes on layout, zoom, minimap, and degradation regressions to improve pass rate.
- Re-run the full suite and refresh this document after each major fix batch.
