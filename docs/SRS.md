# Chronochart Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

This document is the single source of truth for functional and nonâ€‘functional requirements. Requirements are identified by stable IDs and linked to automated tests and key implementation entry points. Status reflects lifecycle: Proposed â†’ Approved â†’ Implemented â†’ Verified.

## 1. Overview and Scope
- Product: Chronochart, a web app to create and explore timelines.
- Scope: Timeline rendering, zoom/pan navigation, minimap, event card layout, overflow indication, and axis scales. User accounts, collaboration, and media are out of scope.

## 2. Definitions and Assumptions
- View window: Normalized [0..1] interval over the full timeline span.
- Halfâ€‘column: Independent stacking context above/below axis, max two cards, with overflow badges.
- Verified: Requirement has at least one passing test covering acceptance criteria.

## 3. Nonâ€‘Functional Requirements
- CC-REQ-NFR-001 Performance (Approved)
  - The app remains responsive with ~100 visible events; interactions complete within 2s.
  - Verification: smoke/perf passes in CI; manual profiling.
- CC-REQ-NFR-002 Accessibility (Approved)
  - Overlays are focusâ€‘trapped, labeled, and announce changes.
  - Verification: spot checks; a11y audit (future automation).

## 4. Functional Requirements

  - Implementation: src/layout/LayoutEngine.ts (positioning), capacity/spacing constants


- ID: CC-REQ-LAYOUT-001
  - Title: No card overlaps at any zoom level
  - Type: Functional | Priority: High | Status: Approved
  - Acceptance: At all zoom levels and view windows, visible event cards do not overlap (their bounding boxes never intersect) for baseline datasets (e.g., RFK 1968, JFK 1961–63, Napoleon 1769–1821) and during navigation/zoom interactions.
  - Verification:
    - tests/v5/03-non-overlap-fit.spec.ts (RFK non-overlap, Napoleon Fit-All non-overlap)
    - tests/v5/29-deep-zoom-comprehensive-sliding.spec.ts (zero overlaps at maximum zoom across sliding positions)
  - Implementation: src/layout/LayoutEngine.ts (positioning, spacing, separation), src/layout/DeterministicLayoutComponent.tsx

- ID: CC-REQ-CARD-FULL-001
  - Title: Full cards display multi-line content without clipping
  - Type: Functional | Priority: High | Status: Approved
  - Acceptance: Full cards use the entire card height (~169px) for title and multi-line description (no artificial 2-line clamp), text wraps within the card and does not clip.
  - Verification: Visual checks in v5/03 and presence of sufficient lines in full cards; no overlaps per CC-REQ-LAYOUT-001.
  - Implementation: src/layout/config.ts (full height), src/layout/DeterministicLayoutComponent.tsx (remove aggressive clamps)

- ID: CC-REQ-CARD-COMPACT-001
  - Title: Compact cards match full card width and show 1–2 lines of text
  - Type: Functional | Priority: High | Status: Approved
  - Acceptance: Compact cards have same width as full cards, height ~78px, and display 1–2 lines of description without clipping.
  - Verification: Visual checks at compact density; no overlaps per CC-REQ-LAYOUT-001.
  - Implementation: src/layout/config.ts (compact width/height), src/layout/DeterministicLayoutComponent.tsx (render compact description)

- ID: CC-REQ-LAYOUT-SEMICOL-001
  - Title: Semi-columns use vertical space efficiently with reduced gaps
  - Type: Functional | Priority: Medium | Status: Approved
  - Acceptance: For semi-columns (half-columns) with two full cards, vertical margins are reduced (top/bottom/timeline) and inter-card spacing lowered to improve utilization; one anchor per semi-column.
  - Verification: v5/10-space-optimization.spec.ts (vertical/horizontal usage), anchor tests in v5/33; no overlaps per CC-REQ-LAYOUT-001.
  - Implementation: src/layout/LayoutEngine.ts (margins/spacing), anchor model unchanged (one per semi-column)

### Zoom and Navigation
- ID: CC-REQ-ZOOM-001
  - Title: Zoom filters visible events and preserves cursor anchoring
  - Type: Functional | Priority: High | Status: Verified
  - Acceptance: Zooming changes the number of visible cards and keeps the time under the cursor stable (within reasonable drift); boundaries clamp cleanly.
  - Verification: tests/v5/17-zoom-functionality.spec.ts (Zoom controls should filter visible events)
  - Implementation: src/app/hooks/useViewWindow.ts (zoom/zoomAtCursor), src/App.tsx (wheel handler)

- ID: CC-REQ-ZOOM-002
  - Title: Mouse wheel zoom is supported
  - Type: Functional | Priority: Medium | Status: Verified

  - Type: Functional | Priority: High | Status: Verified
  - Acceptance: As zoom changes, the minimapâ€™s window width changes accordingly.
  - Verification: tests/v5/21-timeline-minimap.spec.ts (view window indicator reflects zoom)
  - Implementation: src/components/TimelineMinimap.tsx; src/app/hooks/useViewWindow.ts

- ID: CC-REQ-MINIMAP-004

  - Implementation: src/components/TimelineMinimap.tsx

### Overflow Indicators
- ID: CC-REQ-OVERFLOW-001

  - Implementation: Same as above

### Adaptive Timeline Scales
- ID: CC-REQ-AXIS-001
  - Title: Adaptive scales progress from decades/years to months/days/hours
  - Type: Functional | Priority: High | Status: Verified
  - Acceptance: Across zoom levels, labels reflect appropriate units; counts stay within readable bounds.
  - Verification: tests/v5/34-adaptive-timeline-scales.spec.ts (adaptivity); tests/v5/35-adaptive-scale-visibility.spec.ts
  - Implementation: src/timeline/hooks/useAxisTicks.ts; src/layout/DeterministicLayoutComponent.tsx (scale rendering)

- ID: CC-REQ-AXIS-002
  - Title: Scale readability and spacing
  - Type: Functional | Priority: Medium | Status: Verified
  - Acceptance: Labels avoid overlaps and maintain reasonable density at different zooms.

  - Verification: tests/v5/34-adaptive-timeline-scales.spec.ts (edge cases)
  - Implementation: Same as above

## 5. Verification Notes
- Tests are tagged with requirement IDs via Playwright annotations for traceability.
- A future CI step can parse these annotations to build a Reqâ†”Test matrix without duplicating requirements in a second file.
