## Implementation Notes

### Card Type Selection Logic

The degradation engine uses event count to determine card type:

```typescript
// From DegradationEngine.ts
if (eventCount <= 2) {
 return 'full'; // 1-2 events: full cards
} else if (eventCount <= 4) {
 return 'compact'; // 3-4 events: compact cards
} else {
 return 'title-only'; // 5+ events: title-only cards
}
```

### Mixed Card Type Scenarios

**Current Implementation**: Mixed card types are now implemented via `FEATURE_FLAGS.ENABLE_MIXED_CARD_TYPES` (see `src/config/featureFlags.ts`). When enabled, cards within spatial clusters can use different card types based on chronological priority.

#### When Mixed Types Are Allowed

Mixed card types can be used ONLY when a spatial cluster meets ALL these conditions:

1. **Zero Overflow**: No overflow in either above OR below half-columns
2. **Space Available**: Sufficient vertical space to accommodate mixed heights
3. **Event Count**: 3-5 events where mixed types provide better information density
4. **Chronological Priority**: Earlier events receive full cards, later events degrade

#### Example Scenarios

| Scenario | Above Events | Below Events | Cluster Overflow? | Card Types | Reasoning |
|----------|--------------|--------------|-------------------|------------|-----------|
| **Scenario 1: No Overflow** | 3 events (2024-01-01, 01-02, 01-03) | 0 events | NO | Above: 1 full + 2 compact | Safe to use mixed types - no overflow in cluster |
| **Scenario 2: Overflow Above** | 5 events (overflows) | 2 events | YES | Above: 5 title-only<br>Below: 2 full | Uniform degradation - overflow forces title-only above |
| **Scenario 3: Overflow Below** | 2 events | 5 events (overflows) | YES | Above: 2 compact<br>Below: 5 title-only | Cluster coordination - overflow below forces degradation |
| **Scenario 4: Both Overflow** | 6 events (overflows) | 7 events (overflows) | YES | Above: title-only<br>Below: title-only | Uniform title-only due to cluster overflow |
| **Scenario 5: Sparse Cluster** | 1 event | 1 event | NO | Above: 1 full<br>Below: 1 full | Full cards when plenty of space available |

#### Critical Rule: Cluster Coordination

> **Spatial clusters must coordinate overflow checking across above/below half-columns.**
>
> If the above half-column has overflow, the below half-column must also consider this when selecting card types, even if the below section has available space. This prevents visual inconsistency where one side shows full cards while the other is overflowing.

**Anti-Pattern (Bug):**
```
X-Region 500px:
  Above: 5 events → overflowing → showing title-only cards (correct)
  Below: 2 events → no overflow → showing full cards (WRONG!)
  ❌ Visual inconsistency - bottom shows luxury while top is cramped
```

**Correct Pattern:**
```
X-Region 500px:
  Above: 5 events → cluster has overflow
  Below: 2 events → cluster has overflow
  ✅ Both degrade uniformly (title-only or compact based on total cluster density)
```

### Overflow Event Management

Overflow events are stored separately from visible events:

- **Primary Events**: Events that fit within card capacity and are displayed
- **Overflow Events**: Events that exceed capacity, stored in `group.overflowEvents` array
- **View Window Filtering**: Overflow events filtered by visible time window to prevent leftover badges

### Badge Merging Strategy

Overflow badges use spatial proximity merging:

1. Identify badges within minimum spacing threshold
2. Group nearby badges into merge candidates
3. Calculate centroid position for merged badge
4. Display single badge with combined count

This prevents visual clutter when multiple half-columns have overflow in close proximity.
