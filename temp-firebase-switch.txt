To switch to hardcoded Firebase config:

1. In src/utils/migrateLocalStorage.ts, change line 7:
   FROM: import { db } from '../lib/firebase';
   TO:   import { db } from '../lib/firebase-temp';

2. Restart dev server:
   npm run dev

3. Try migration again

This bypasses the env variable loading issue.
