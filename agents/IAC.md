```
Count all Playwright tests in the PowerTimeline project. 

Look in the tests/ directory and count:
1. Total number of test files (*.spec.ts)
2. Total number of individual test cases (look for test() or it() calls)
3. Breakdown by folder (tests/editor/, tests/home/, tests/admin/, tests/db/, tests/production/, etc.)

Report the counts in a clear summary format.
```

Counted all `*.spec.ts` under `tests/` by scanning for `test()`/`it()` calls (excludes `test.skip`/`it.skip`). Three specs only contain skipped tests: `tests/editor/33-timeline-separators.spec.ts`, `tests/editor/33-directional-anchors.spec.ts`, `tests/editor/63-minimap-overlay-visibility.spec.ts`.

**Totals**
- 98 spec files
- 322 `test`/`it` calls

**By folder**
- tests/editor: 66 files, 201 tests
- tests/home: 8 files, 40 tests
- tests/production: 10 files, 25 tests
- tests/admin: 6 files, 23 tests
- tests/db: 2 files, 8 tests
- tests/auth: 1 file, 8 tests
- tests/user: 2 files, 8 tests
- tests/e2e: 2 files, 6 tests
- tests/ (root): 1 file, 3 tests

If you want to include skipped tests too, the total would be 388 across the same files.
