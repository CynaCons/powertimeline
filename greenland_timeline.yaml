      - Prevent Soviet expansion into the Arctic
      - Control strategic North Atlantic routes

      This offer set a precedent for future US acquisition attempts (2019, 2025-2026).

      **Strategic Context:**
      - China controls ~90% of global rare earth production
      - Greenland's deposits could diversify supply chains
      - Beijing frames Arctic as part of "Polar Silk Road" (Belt and Road Initiative)

      **US Concern:** Chinese investment could give Beijing leverage over Greenland's political future and infrastructure (airports, ports).
